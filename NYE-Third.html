	<h1> July 2021 </h1>
	<p> July felt like the Spring of our lives. I was working hard to secure a full-time and you were working hard to secure Sarorius. I am glad that even though I lost at darts that night at Tully's, I never felt more like a winner when you got that acceptance call. </p>

	<h1> August 2021 </h1>
	<p> It was my very first time in LI. One of my many visits from where we stand today. But that first week was so special. It was like playing house the way you do when you are a small kid. Now everytime I come down, I feel like I am in my own space. My vacation house sort of a feeling. Apart from the tiny bed you have, I'd rate the trip a solid 7/10 lol. </p>

	<h1> September 2021 </h1>
	<p> The semester had begun and we both had things to do on our own but we still prioritized each other. Initially we took time off studying and working on assignements to figuring that we could just accompany each other silently on FT while getting our individual things done. </p>
