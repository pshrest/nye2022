	<h1> January 2021 </h1>
	<p> The beginning of the year is always special. But this year was a little extra. Somehow when I look back at the start of us, I realize that deep down I knew you would last more than a couple of conversations.</p>

	<h1> February 2021 </h1>
	<p> The second month of the year but the month of a lot of firsts. First time sharing meaningful aspects of our life. First time getting comfortable with each other's humor. Most importantly, first time knowing that you live in 6912. </p>

	<h1> March 2021 </h1>
	<p> March was so much fun. It made me feel so alive. From the first letter I sent you to the hummus you sent me to many more. This exchange was foundational to our relationship. A little toxic too because I remember I would want you to be with me at all times! </p>
