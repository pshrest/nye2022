	<h1> April 2021 </h1>
	<p> This was a month of longing. Deep conversations and eternal wait for when we could take the next step of our journey. And while we waited to give each other our hearts, we did share a heart on Snapchat. </p>

	<h1> May 2021 </h1>
	<p> May is when we first met. The day we met I wasn't ready to commit. I told myself I "may" date this man. A couple weeks later, on May 23, we made it official. </p>

	<h1> Jun 2021 </h1>
	<p> June was truly something different. We shared one of our most precious days in Tully's earlier in the month. And a cherry on top, the end of this marked the start of a new journey together. It started with Boston but we've created memories in a lot more. </p>
